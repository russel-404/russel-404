# Hi, I'm Russel Dsouza - aka `russel-404` 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with 2+ years of experience crafting clean, fast, and minimal UIs using **React** - and yes, I occasionally break things on purpose (on Arch Linux, of course 😎).

While I’ve been deep in web dev, I’m now shifting gears - diving into the world of **Linux, servers, and system administration**, building a solid foundation toward a career in **cybersecurity**.
